Create a file design.pdf and document the following:
• Provide your relational schema definitions in text form, including the attributes for each relation. Make sure to clearly indicate your chosen keys (including primary and foreign).
• An Entity-Relation (ER) diagram that describes your schema. Our advice is to use the ER diagram as a starting point to help determine your schema, rather than the other way around. Make sure to include the actual ER diagram in your design.pdf file.
